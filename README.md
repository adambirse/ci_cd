## Google Cloud CI/CD with Kubernetes and Travis CI

This Project is a simple Hello World example for deploying automatically from 
a public github repo to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on Google Cloud.  It is deployed using Travis CI


###  Before getting started

- Create a Google Cloud account
- Follow this [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-hello-kubernetes/index.html) to create your own Kubernetes cluster
- Create a service token
- Add service token to Travis and other environment variables
  
  
#### Create your service token


1. In your GCP Console project, open the Credentials page.
2. Click Create credentials > Service account key.
3. Under Service account select New service account.
4. Enter a Service account name such as continuous-integration-test.
5. Under Role, select Project > Editor.
6. Under Key type, select JSON.
7. Click Create. The GCP Console downloads a new JSON file to your computer. The name of this file starts with your project ID. Make sure to store this file securely.  It cannot be downloaded again
8.  Base64 encode this json for adding to Travis `base64 <json_secret.json>`
    
### Add Environment variables to Travis.

The following environment variables need to be added to Travis:

  - PROJECT_NAME_STG=<your_google_cloud_project>
  - CLUSTER_NAME_STG=<your_kubernetes_cluster>
  - CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE=europe-west2-a
  - GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY = <the_encoded_token_from_above>
  
  
    
### Deploy

- Any changes committed to master will be deployed to your cluster (assuming tests pass!)
- Once deployed the first time you will need to wait for the IP to become available.  You can watch for this with `kubectl get services --watch`
